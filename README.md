# React Interview Project
Salad Interview Project for React developers

## Goal
Create a React application that retrieves and displays the list of GPUs supported by Salad.

## UX/UI
Please use the wireframe here for the layout. Match the style (font size, color, padding...) to our [website](https://www.salad.io/). Please use the Work Sans font found [here](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans)

## Bootstrapping the project
Up to you, but please use Tyescript. We use and recommend [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Retrieving data
The supported GPU list is available at `https://api.salad.io/core/master/get-gpu-whitelist`. At Salad we use [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios), but use whatever you're comfortable with.

## Submitting the solution
Create a new repo on your github account and send us a link. It should be clear how to build and run the project locally.

## Bonus (don't need to be in the below specific order)
* Use ES6 syntax including arrow functions, destructuring and async/await
* Adding a spinner when information is loading
* Deal with errors coming from the backend
* Some sort of Unit Test
* Adding state management (additional Bonus if using Mobx)
* Show common tools used for you daily development environment (linters, code formatter and so on)
